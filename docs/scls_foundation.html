                                <h3>What is SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" ?</h3>
<p>As mentionned in the name, SCLS Foundation is the foundation of the SCLS libraries.
It s named after the very known mathematician Leonhard Euler, one of the foundation of modern mathematics.
It contains a lot of tools, which are too little to have their own entire SCLS part, but too big and used to be implemented in each single SCLS files.
As a foundation, it is made to be the simplest possible.
</p>
<h3>How to use SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" ?</h3>
<p>
The simpliest way to use the library is to download its source code, and directly put it in your project.
So, compiler the source files, and include the headers.
Keep in mind that EVERYTHING documentated here use the "scls" namespace.
Moreover, for portability reason, there is a macro that you should add at he beginning of your main file (after including SCLS libraries) : "SCLS_INIT".

<h3>Debugguer handling</h3>
<p>SCLS Foundation offers an easy and efficient way to debug your code, with the debugging tools.
It is made with a lot of output capabilities, made to be the clearer possible.</br>

<h3>File handling</h3>
<p>The C++ file handling system can be some kind of complex sometimes, and annoying other times.
SCLS contains a part made to easily use file, inspired from how others language does it.</br>

<h3>Text / XML handling</h3>
<p>A lot of things used in SCLS uses the XML format, easily handled by SCLS Foundation.
Indeed, SCLS Foundation contains a lot of features to handle XML, or even less precise text.</br>

<h3>Binary handling</h3>
<p>As the root of everything in a computer, SCLS Foundation also contains a lot of tools made to easily use binary in C++.
Actually, it is kinda dangerous to use it in a lot of cases, because an error mixed with bad luck can literally destroy the computer.
In SCLS, this operations can be made surely and simply, reducing the risk.</br>
