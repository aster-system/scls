            <h1>SCLS Image "Michelangelo"</h1>
                Imagine combining the power of C++ with the realisation of image.
This can be done with our image library : SCLS Image "Michelangelo".

                                <h3>What is SCLS Image "Michelangelo" ?</h3>
<p>Using a terminal for your code, it's good.
Using a visual representation with an image, this is better.
This is why this library is made for : handle images.
It is named after one of the greatest painter of all time : Michelangelo.
With this library, the goal is to make the using of images in C++ very simple.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>To be used, SCLS Image does not need a lot of others libraries, but some are needed.
The first needed library is the very known <a href="https://zlib.net/" target="_blank">ZLib library</a>.
The second library needed is the <a href="https://freetype.org/" target="_blank">Freetype library</a>.
The needed informations to download this libraries are avaible on their website.
Of course, you will also need the other low-level SCLS libraries <a href="./scls_foundation.html" target="_blank">SCLS Foundation</a> and <a href="./scls_math.html" target="_blank">SCLS Math</a>.</p>
<p>The default values of thoses libraries path in SCLS are directly in the system include path.
However, if you're include are in an other path, you can define a predirective before including the library, to avoid this problem.
For SCLS Foundation, the needed macro is SCLS_FOUNDATION_PATH, and it should be the "scls_foundation.h" file of the library.
For SCLS Math, the needed macro is SCLS_MATH_PATH, and it should be the "scls_math.h" file of the library.
For ZLib, the needed macro is SCLS_ZLIB_PATH, and it should be the "zlib.h" file of the library.
For Freetype, the needed macro is SCLS_FREETYPE_PATH, and it should be the "ft2build.h" file of the library.</p>
<h3>Download SLCS Image</h3>
<p>As this version is still experimental, the only way to downlaod SCLS Image is to use MediaFire.
Keep in mind that the current version is header-only, and the headers are stored in a zip file.
So, if you browser mind about that, the zip only contains headers, so no security problems.
The zip is avaible, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/vjyhz8lmw0h9b7m/scls_image_0_2.zip/file">at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Everything in SCLS Image uses a specific class : the class "Image".
It is made to easily handle an image, with image loading and saving, editing...

<p>Generating text is an action that we all see a lot of time every day.
However, it is a more complicated thing that it looks.
Fortunately, SCLS Image contains a set of tools, made to easily handle graphic text generation.
