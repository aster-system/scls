                                <h3>Create an image</h3>
<p>The "Image" class is made to use images in C++.
It can uses a lot of constructor, to make a blank image, or to load a pre-existing image
The image is stored in the memory with a "char*".
It is in general an RGB image, with 8 bits by components.
You can also add an alpha canal to it.</p>
<h3>Modify the image</h3>
<p>The most simple image manipulation is the editing of a single pixel.
It is easily made with the "set_pixel" methods.
By combining a lot of "set_pixel", you can draw a rectangle with the "draw_rect" methods.
You can also fill it with "fill_rect".
If you prefer 1 dimension shape, you can draw a line with the "draw_line" methods.
If you prefer triangle, you can fill a triangle with the "fill_triangle" methods.
However, if you want to edit all the image directly, use the "fill" methods.
You can also couple more than one image, with the "paste" methods.
An image can also be flipped, horizontally with "flip_x" and vertically with "flip_y".
